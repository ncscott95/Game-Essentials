#INTRO

NARRATION
The clock ticks away.

NARRATION
Another day has passed.

NARRATION
You’re one of millions living in a dense metropolis, teeming with others like you who are doing whatever they can to get by in this capitalistic hell.

NARRATION
The only home you’ve ever known.

NARRATION
And the only life you’ve ever known—that of those at the bottom of the city’s hierarchy.

NARRATION
You struggle to get by, doing whatever you can to make it another day.

NARRATION
The difficulties experienced by the impoverished go ignored by those above it, turning their gazes away to instead look upon their lavish lives.

NARRATION
Food insecurity, inability to afford housing, all atop a recent increase in monster appearances.

NARRATION
Terrifying creatures that most had only heard stories of, their presence brings ruin to those unfortunate to be within the range of their destruction.

NARRATION
All unseen by those at the top.

NARRATION
Whilst searching for a way to earn enough to pay this month’s rent, a job listing catches your eye.

NARRATION
“---- company. For our future.”

NARRATION
A position offering lucrative pay with no skill requirements, only asking for decent physical health.

NARRATION
Super sketchy. Way too good to be true.

NARRATION
...but when you’re not sure if you’ll survive ‘til the end of the week, you’ve gotta take anything you can get.
(test_sfx)

???
Welcome to your first day at ------!

???
I’m Ven, director of the research department—and your new manager.



#OFFICE

NARRATION
Your new manager stands before you, donning a friendly smile.

NARRATION
His warm personality and cheerful expression give the impression of someone easy to approach.

NARRATION
Yet he has an undoubtable air of reliability, as his confidence leaves no room to question his position as your superior.

VEN
As you know, the recent increase in monster appearances has been a major cause for concern.

VEN
Monsters bringing destruction to heavily populated areas are kinda hard to ignore after all.

VEN
Considering the circumstances, our company has been redirecting more resources into monster research.

VEN
Which is great, since my team’s expanding and I get to meet lots of promising people like you!

VEN
I wasn’t expecting the sheer number of onboardings I’ve been leading as of late, but I definitely don’t mind getting to know my new subordinates a bit before working together.

NARRATION
His eyes hold a warmth that’s not often found within the harsh environment of the city.

NARRATION
It’s kind, yet unfamiliar.

VEN
On that note, I’ll leave you to settle in at your desk for now. You deserve a break from my chattering.

VEN
I still have more to show you though, so come find me when you’re ready to move on.



#INTERACT_MAT

COWORKER
Oh, hey!

COWORKER
You’re the new guy, right?

COWORKER
I’m Mat. Nice to meet you!

MAT
Feel free to let me know if you’ve got any questions when Ven’s not around.

MAT
I’m not a manager like he is, but I’ve been here a while so I can help out if he’s not available.




#INTERACT_READY

VEN
I see you’re ready to move on. Follow me.



#LAB

VEN
This is our laboratory. We have numerous containment units hosting monsters that we’ve captured.

VEN
No need to worry about a rogue monster rampaging through the halls. These walls are sturdy, so we’ve never experienced a containment breach.

VEN
—not yet at least, haha.

VEN
Everyday you’ll be collecting data from the unit you’re assigned to. Since it’s your first day, you’ll be handling a weaker monster today.

VEN
And just so you know, some of our employees experience strange phenomena when engaging with the monsters.

VEN
If anything weird starts happening, stay calm. I can’t guarantee that I’ll know how to help with the symptoms, but I’ll lend an ear if you’d like to talk about it.

VEN
I think you’re ready to get to work. I’m sure you’ll do well, so go ahead and enter the unit.



#REPORT

VEN
Good job! You did well for your first day on the job.

VEN
You’ve got potential in this company.

VEN
Your quick thinking and capabilities are just what we’re looking for.

VEN
Ahem, back to onboarding.

VEN
At the end of each day you’ll report your findings back to me.

VEN
The data you’ve collected will be collected and sent for analysis.

VEN
I’m sure you'll be tired at the end of each day though, so you can fill out the paperwork the day after.

VEN
As long as all the raw data is reported back to me, I’ll make sure that it’s all recorded before leaving.

VEN
You’ve done great today. Head home and get some rest.
